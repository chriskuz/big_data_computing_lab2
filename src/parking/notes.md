* Initialization:
Start your Spark session and create the Spark context.

* Data Ingestion:
Read your CSV file into an RDD or DataFrame.

* Mapping (Transformations):
Apply a transformation (using map) to extract the violation time and convert it to 24-hour format—mirroring your mapper’s logic.

* Aggregation (Reducing):
Use a transformation like reduceByKey to sum up the counts per hour. Then, apply additional transformations to find the maximum count, similar to what your reducer does.

* Action:
Finally, use an action like collect to bring the results back to the driver, where you can then output or further process the maximum count result.
